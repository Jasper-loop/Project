            <h1>Who We Are</h1>
            <p>On May 10, 1995, the Ramcar Group of Companies, one of the largest multinationals in the Philippines and the biggest battery manufacturer in Southeast Asia, acquired the master franchise of Mister Donut from the  Duskin Company, Ltd. Since then, Ramcar introduced an aggressive management policy and revitalized Mister Donut-Philippines in a bid to attain world class status.  </p>
            <p>At present, Mister Donut-Philippines has over 2000 shops and outlets, including its innovative tie-ups with 7-Eleven, Petroleum Shops, and other partner institutional accounts. The shops are being catered to by 20 Mister Donut plants strategically located in Luzon, Visayas and Mindanao.</p>

                <h1>Growing through innovation</h1>
                <p>Mister Donut continuously brings in introductions of new variants at least every quarter.  We have invested in product development to ensure that we come up not just with delicious donuts, but with varieties that will entice the changing moods of the market. We have adapted the taste into what we call, “tamang-tamang tamis” that suits the Filipino palate. Flavors that are close to the hearts of young and old alike. We are keen to study the market and cater to their needs, serving not just donuts, but a variety of baked goods and even quick meals and drinks.</p>

                <h1>Groing through franschise</h1>
                <p>If there is one thing we have learned through the years, it is that without the help of our franchisees - our partners - we would not come this far. It is because of this relationship that we have built with them that people continue to invest in Mister Donut. It inspires us to make sure that everything the franchisees need on their end, they can provide for. Be it site selection, crew training, and even product development.</p>
                <p>Mister Donut has recognized that it is through them that we are able to succeed. Instead of just focusing on sales and demanding higher output, we rather see this as a joint venture. When things don’t look too well on the other end, we don’t hesitate to see what could be wrong and what we can do to help. It’s a relationship built more like a family than anything else. It’s the genuine caring, the genuine happiness for each of the franchisees’ success. It is not a secret formula, it is not a complex permutation. It is just plain old dedication to do good business and be good partners. What a wise investment indeed.</p>
